Transmission Electron Microscopy is a type of electron microscopy that uses electron beams to reproduce an image of a small sample with high resolution. Transmission Electron Microscopes are in a sense similar to a Light Microscope in which photons are transmitted through a sample to form an image. Transmission Electron Microscopes however, transmit electrons through an ultrathin sample which are then projected onto a detector to produce a high resolution of image of the diffraction patterns. These microscopes have pushed our understanding of crystallography and allows us to visualize different crystal structures. The program studies and simulates a simple cubic structure of Polonium along with the diffraction patterns that are created by observing a Polonium sample under a Transmission Electron Microscope.

The program is set up to take an input vector which represents the zone axis which is the direction the planes intersect with each other. Using the miller indices chosen we are able to extrapolate the diffraction pattern that may arise from using a Transmission Electron Microscope. The diffraction patterns are caused by electron to atom interaction which can be calculated by Weiss Zone Law. Using these diffraction patterns physicist are able to gain interesting information about the sample of polonium. The diffraction patterns get more complicated when studying different crystal structures.
